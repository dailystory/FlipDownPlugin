The Countdown Timer is a WordPress plugin that makes it simple to add a countdown timer to your pages or posts.

### BACKED BY A TRUSTED TEAM
The plugin is built and maintained by [DailyStory](https://www.dailystory.com/), a marketing automation platform. This plugin was created after several of our customers asked how they could create a similar plugin for their WordPress websites.

### DOCUMENTATION AND SUPPORT

## How to use the plugin
The FlipDown plugin makes use of a WordPress shortcode. Simply add the shortcode within your WordPress page or post using the following syntax:

[flipdown date="2023-11-27T00:00:00-0500"]

You can also change the theme from dark (default) to light:

[flipdown date="2023-11-27T00:00:00-0500" theme="light"]

The data should be in the format of a JavaScript ISO date with the offset for your location. The above example creates a countdown timer for Cyber Monday on November 27, 2023.

It's worth mentioning that the date should includes zeros for months less than 10 and times less than 10. 

For example, August 7th would be written as 2023-08-07.
