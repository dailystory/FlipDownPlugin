# FlipDown WordPress Plugin
This WordPress plugin by [DailyStory](https://www.dailystory.com/) enables users to use a simple short code to insert a FlipDown countdown timer in WordPress pages or posts. We initially developed this plug for our own website to easily add countdown timers for webinars, but several customers asked about using it for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

The source code [published on the WordPress Plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dailystory/#description) and you can [read more about DailyStory WordPress integration here](https://www.dailystory.com/wordpress/). 

The FlipDown plugin uses the [FlipDown JS library](https://github.com/PButcher/flipdown).
